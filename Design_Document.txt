Main Function: chose_idx_ver3(seq, num_rolls, seq_length, max_attempts)This function is lynchpin of the whole program. While the number of the accepted sampled sequences is less than the number of how many sequences the user chooses to sample and the attempts at successful conditions are less than the max attempts at conditional success the function will do the following:1. Sample a random set of candidate start indices within the DNA string (the subject string) entered2. Check for any overlap between those candidate indices given the seq_length. If the starting index + seq_length overlap, then add that as an attempt and resample. If we get a set of indices that are non-overlapping then add them to a candidate list of DNA strings to be put through the conditions.3. Because this program is designed specifically for 10x Visium Probes we will reverse transcribe them immediately after non-overlap confirmation.4. The set of strings are put through the condition following conditional functions. Each condition is detailed in the technical note for Custom 10x Visium Probes. All of these functions and their wet-lab significance is detailed for each of them.a. check_gc_content(rt_candidate_seq, min_gc, max_gc)b. RT_LHS_check(rt_candidate_seq)c.

If all of those conditions are not satisfied then the an attempt is added and we start over with a new set of sequences*ArgumentsSeq = a single string of DNA nucleotide with not aesthetic character such as new line (“\n”) or Microsoft word inserted characters (“\w”).Num_rolls = How many sequences within the range “seq_length”  would you like to sample from the whole DNA sequence?
